# DIYToolbox
Quick SwiftUI demo - Just practicing building basic layouts in SwiftUI. Static data source for now - not the focus.

The UI components are broken down into small reusable "Views"
- ContentView: the main root view of the app
- CellView: the view used for both project and tool cells (image optional)
- ProjectCellView: a CellView plus a CarouselView
- CircleView: an image presented in a circle
- CarouselView a horizontallly scrollable collection of CircleViews with labels underneath

The goods are in the DIY/Views folder.
